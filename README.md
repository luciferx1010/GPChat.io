# GPChat App ðŸ“± using Websockets

This is a simple chat application built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io.

## Introduction

This project aims to create a real-time chat application using websockets. We're utilizing the Socket.io library, which is a wrapper around Websockets. Socket.io makes it easy to establish real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers.

## What is Websocket ?

WebSockets are an alternative to HTTP communication in Web Application, they offer full-duplex communication, that is, it is, bi-directional and that means the data can flow in both ways, so it can flow from client to the server and also from server to the client.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Socket.io
